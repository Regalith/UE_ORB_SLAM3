# Project Title

ORB SLAM3 Unreal Plugin

## Description

A proof of concept wrapper for ORB SLAM3 packaged into an Unreal Engine 5 plugin. An instance of ORB SLAM 3 is generated by creating a FRunnable thread during startup of a UGameInstanceSubsystem. Currently restricted to Linux only, as cross compiling with all the dependencies with mingw-w64 is proving to be a headache. Still need to modify System.cc to fully handle shutting down all child threads when the UGameInstanceSubsystem is destroed on end play, or switch to a UEngineSubsystem so that ORB SLAM follows the initialization and shutdown lifecycle of Unreal Engine itself. Should also probably build all the libraries as static to avoid any dependency headaches.
